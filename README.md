# Tenexity Plugin Marketplace

**Plugins for HVAC and plumbing wholesale distributors using [CoWork for Distributors](https://tenexity.ai/distributors).**

This is the public Tenexity marketplace of CoWork OS plugins. Add it once to your CoWork desktop app and every Tenexity plugin — current and future — becomes installable in one click.

## How distributors install this marketplace

Inside CoWork, click **Customise** (sliders icon, bottom-left) → **Plugins** → click **+** next to "Personal plugins" → **Add marketplace**, then paste:

```
tenexity/cowork-distributor-plugins
```

Click **Sync**. CoWork shows a standard third-party safety notice (Anthropic shows this for every non-Anthropic plugin marketplace — it's not specific to Tenexity). Click **Sync** to confirm.

You'll see Tenexity's plugins listed under the **Personal** tab. Click **+** on each one you want to install.

## Available plugins

Plugins are added here as they ship. Run `cat .claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for the live list.

Shipping in v0.1:

- **Tenexity Setup — HVAC & Plumbing Distributor** (single-user) — bundles three skills for solo distributors and small shops: Onboarding Coach, System Review, First Week Guide. Pairs with `CoWork-for-Distributors-v1.0/`.
- **Tenexity Setup Team — HVAC & Plumbing Distributor** (multi-user) — bundles four skills for distributors deploying across 5-50 employees: Setup Company (admin), Setup User (per-employee), System Review, First Week Guide. Two-layer architecture (COMPANY + USER). Pairs with `CoWork-for-Distributors-v2.0/`.
- **Inventory Optimisation Coach** — coaches distributors through dead-stock analysis, reorder-point reviews, branch-level transfer rebalancing, vendor return programs, and working-capital snapshots. ERP-agnostic; you paste exports.
- **Rebate Reconciliation Specialist** — coaches distributors through vendor rebate program reconciliation, threshold tracking, claim drafting, and leakage identification. Vendor-agnostic; you paste program terms.

The **setup plugins** package the setup skills into a one-click install — no file-permissions roulette, no marketplace fallback for skills.

The **two operational plugins** are scaffold-layer free coaches — they explain methodology, ask for ERP exports as pasted input, and produce one-shot analyses. They do not connect to ERPs, manufacturer portals, or run scheduled jobs. Ongoing automation, ERP integration, and persistent state are part of paid Tenexity pilots — see [tenexity.ai/distributors](https://tenexity.ai/distributors) for pilot details.

## How Tenexity adds new plugins to the marketplace

This marketplace repo is the published surface. The internal build process happens in the parent CoWork-class repo at `tenexity-plugins/`:

1. **Brief and curate.** Write the specialist brief and knowledge base entries in `tenexity-plugins/<NN>-<Specialist>/`.
2. **Run Better Creating's Specialist Sub-Agent Builder** in a CoWork session — it consumes the brief and KB, walks through the 8-step build, and outputs a `.plugin` file.
3. **Unpack the .plugin file** into `tenexity-plugins/marketplace/plugins/<plugin-name>/`. Each plugin's internal structure (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, `README.md`) comes from the Builder.
4. **Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** in this folder — add an entry to the `plugins` array following BC's schema (name, source, description, version, author, category, tags).
5. **Push to the public marketplace repo** at `github.com/tenexity/cowork-distributor-plugins`. From that point distributors who have already added the marketplace see the new plugin appear automatically.

The full build workflow lives in `tenexity-plugins/README.md`.
